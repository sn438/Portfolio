      <p class = "mb-5"> I designed this product because I could not find any products that would allow me to transfer files to an external memory device and the cloud at the same time. During my labs, I wanted to be able to access data through the ease of a flash drive or an SD card, but also have the security of backing up my data on the cloud. I figured that this was an interesting enough use case to try prototyping a product that would be able to read in data from a PC and save it to an SD card and Google Drive. I had already worked with writing data to an SD card through my DAQLite project so I was confident that I would be able to get that part of the project to work. But, I was somewhat unsure about how the Google Drive implementation would fall together. In the past, I had experience working with an ESP8266 on a Feather Huzzah board to add IoT capabilities to a robot, I figured I would be able to use this diverse MCU to be able to connect with Google Drive over a WiFi connection. Luckily, I was able to find many libraries and implementations that would allow me to pass data to Google Drive through an ESP8266.</p>
      <p class = "mb-5"> As of now, I have been working with a USB port on an Ubuntu laptop and FTDI cable to  pass data between my PC and the Feather Huzzah. I have been able to get reliable communication between the two computers by simply reading and writing to a special file corresponding to a USB port through system calls. I am now in the process of implementing my own checksum to ensure that the data I have passed to the Feather Huzzah is in fact entirely correct. In the near future, I hope to get my SD card interface with the Feather Huzzah up and running, and I hope to have the Google Drive connection up soon as well. After that I would like to design a PCB for this project so that I can package up my project a little more nicely.
