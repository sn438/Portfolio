      <p> The last week has been an interesting experience as I have been working on a hodge-podge of unrelated things. As I finished up my last project, DAQLiteFirmware, I was a little stuck about what to proceed with next. But fortunately, I settled my sights quickly on new projects, many new projects. </p>

      <p> Firstly, I began looking at increasing my C fundamentals. I first began my programming journey as a Java developer because my dad was a Java developer; I have taken a lot of classes and completed a lot of assignments in Java over the years. But when I picked up C, I never rigorously practiced my C skills. I have relied on online forums and Stack Overflow posts to accumulate knowledge of C terminology and paradigms. While this method worked, I still wanted a solid base of fundamentals that I could rely on in the future. To achieve this, I have dedicated myself to learning from <i> The C Programming Language (Second Edition) </i> by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. I decided to learn from a textbook as opposed to an online course because in the past, I have had the most success from reading technical literature. While it is certainly more difficult than learning from a teacher, I have found that I remember things better if I have read them in the past. And, Kernighan and Ritchie’s book is the gold standard for C textbooks as far as I have heard. I expect nothing less as Ritchie himself developed C at the prestigious Bell Labs. This last week, I have worked my way through the first chapter and completed most of the exercises in the chapter. I tested my solutions for the exercises somewhat strictly but then again I did not have the official solutions or official test cases to compare my answer to. So I can only give my seal of approval for the solutions as opposed to any legitimate guarantee that they are correct. In other words, use this code at your discretion. I have also uploaded my exercise solutions to a repository called Cprojects. </p>
          
      <p> Next, I wanted to improve my knowledge of the STM32 chipset. You might wonder why I would revisit STM32 when I spent such a long time working with an STM32 Discovery Board, and to be honest I should probably work with a different chipset. I have learned a lot about how the STM32 chips work through the DAQLiteFirmware project, but my experimentation was significantly aided by STM32CubeMX. CubeMX is a great tool for being able to leverage powerful and sophisticated STM32 chips towards regular projects; however, CubeMX also hides a lot of the details that go towards writing embedded firmware. I want to familiarize myself with this detail because as far as I know, the other chip manufacturers don’t have a tool like CubeMX. Even if these chip manufactures had such a sophisticated tool, I’m not sure I would want to rely completely on it as I have had my fair share of mishaps with CubeMX. So, I went looking for textbooks that would further my understanding of STM32 chips, and luckily, I cam across <i> Beginning STM32 </i> by Warren Gay. This textbook has been pretty great because it is delves into the basics of the STM32 chip quite closely with clear and concise language. The book works with a development board for the STM32F10C8T6 chip, the same chip I was initially considering using for the DAQLiteFirmware project. The development board comes in a small form and in a shade of blue so many have termed it the Blue Pill. </p>

      <p> I have found that to get the most use out of the textbook, I will need a Linux system to work closely with the Blue Pill, so I spent a good bit of the weekend setting up my laptop to be able to run Ubuntu 19.04. In the past I have tried to run Ubuntu off a bootable USB; however, my laptop, a Lenovo Flex 5, seemed to struggle with running a bootable Ubuntu USB and Windows 10 OS side-by-side. Whenever I would want to use either of the OSes, I would have to modify BIOS settings, which was always very annoying. So, I simply stuck with using Ubuntu for Windows or Cygwin for my Unix needs, but working with the firmware for the Blue Pill needed a full Linux system. Thankfully, I was able to get the bootable USB working on my system with the help of this <a href = https://medium.com/@petragospodneti/windows-10-and-linux-love-hate-dual-boot-problems-d9994cbe16c0>blog post</a>. Thanks to Petra Gospodnetić’s helpful tutorial, I was able to configure the BIOS to accept my Ubuntu USB, and once I got the Ubuntu USB working, I went through the first couple chapters of Beginning STM32 and installed all the necessary software. All the code I will be writing in the future for this book will be uploaded to a new, yet to be created repository. I will inform you guys about it in my next post. </p>
